    <string name="plugin_info">&NEOTERM_API_APP_NAME; is a plugin app for the &NEOTERM_APP_NAME; app
        that executes neoterm-api package commands.
        Check &NEOTERM_APP_NAME; app github %1$s, &NEOTERM_API_APP_NAME; app github %2$s and
        %3$s package github %4$s for more info.

        \n\nThe &NEOTERM_API_APP_NAME; app requires `%3$s` apt package to function.
        Run `pkg install %3$s` to install it.

        \n\nNote that if &NEOTERM_API_APP_NAME; app crashes too many times, then android will mark the
        app as a bad process and you will need to manually start this activity again once for the
        api commands to start working again, otherwise the commands will hang.

        \n\nReports for some crashes may be shown when you restart &NEOTERM_APP_NAME; app.</string>

    <string name="msg_battery_optimization_not_disabled_warning">Android battery optimizations
        should be disabled for the &NEOTERM_API_APP_NAME; app so that neoterm-api script can start
        it from the background if its failing to do so. Do not worry, this will not drain battery,
        the app currently only runs commands when called from neoterm-api script.
        Check https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background and
        https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#background-start-restrictions
        for more info.

        \n\nAlso check https://dontkillmyapp.com for info on vendor specific app killers.
        Depending on vendor you may need to do things like enable AutoStart, disable DuraSpeed,
        enable `Display pop-up windows while running in the background` for the app.</string>
